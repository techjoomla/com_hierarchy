# What is the Hierarchy Management Extension ? 
The hierarchy management extension is a horizontal(Infrastructure) extension by Techjoomla that allows you to set general or context specific hierarchial relations between users. This can be used by other extensions to manage special access control, generate reports and so on. 

Here is a live example of how general and context specific hierarchy can be:

Mark, Swapnil, Mary & Vaishali normally report to Vijay. However Mary and Vaishali have been asked to additionally report to Parth in the special context of a 'Project A'
